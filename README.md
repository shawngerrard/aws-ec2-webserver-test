# aws-ec2-webserver-test

The purpose of this repository is to automatically stand-up an AWS EC2 instance using Docker containers to run a persistant Wordpress instance.

Rationale: To run a POC for providing a web presence for a store.

This guide assumes that you already have an AWS account, AWS CLI set up, and can authenticate to AWS through CLI (eithere root or IAM).

Process is split into three steps:
1. [Creating the EC2 instance](#step1)
2. [Installing Docker within the EC2 instance](#step2)
3. [Deploying the services via Docker containers](#step3)

## Step 1 - Creating the Amazon EC2 Instance <a href="step1"></a>

## Step 2 - Installing Docker into Amazon EC2 <a href="step2"></a>

## Step 3 - Deploying Services via Docker <a href="step3"></a>
